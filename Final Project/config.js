    title: ' How does Construction of Parks Contribute to the Green Gentrification of New York City?',
    subtitle: 'CRP5850 Mapping and Countermapping -\n Yizhou Wang',
    byline: 'A Tale of Two Cities \n New York Governor Mario Cuomo on July 16, 1984',
    para1: '"A shining city is perhaps all the President sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. But there is another city; there is another part to the shining the city; the part where some people can not pay their mortgages, and most young people can not afford one; where students can not afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate. In this part of the city there are more poor than ever, more families in trouble, more and more people who need help but can not find it. Even worse: There are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there. And there are people who sleep in the city streets, in the gutter, where the glitter does not show. There are ghettos where thousands of young people, without a job or an education, give their lives away to drug dealers every day (Duffy & Leeman,2005)." ',

            description: 'New York City covers only over 300 square miles and has over 8 million residents, making it one of the densest and busiest cities in the world; It is also one of the most unequal regions (Black & Ricard, 2020).   <br>   <br> According to the World Bank, the National Gini Index of the United States in 2010 was 0.403, while the US Census estimates the Gini Index of New York City to be 0.55 (US Census, 2020; World Bank, 2010).   <br>   <br> Many studies have shown that more affluent neighborhoods may have more accessibility to green spaces, and that such environmental improvements may result in the displacement of lower income residents (Anderson et al., 2012). However, the role of parks in these green spaces has been less studied.   <br>   <br> Currently, there is extensive debate in the field of urban planning about how urban parks affect gentrification (Weiss et al., 2011). Some research suggests that parks can increase the attractiveness of neighborhoods, contribute to rising real estate values, and lead to forced displacement of residents in poor neighborhoods, such as in the park slope area of Brooklyn where median incomes tripled over 50 years (Halasz, 2018).

Originally, it was an unsafe street-level tracks for the New York Central Railroad in the mid-1800s. The West Side Improvement project in 1924 aimed to eliminate street-level crossings, resulting in the creation of the elevated rail line known as the High Line. It was mainly used to transported goods and passed through buildings.    Train usage declined in the 1960s-1980s, leading to section demolitions. Calls for complete demolition followed, but in 1983, efforts to repurpose the structure began. However, in 1990s, despite being considered an eyesore, a hidden garden of wild plants thrived. Friends of the High Line, founded in 1999 by Joshua David and Robert Hammond, advocated for its preservation. This non-profit maintains and operates the High Line, turning it from an abandoned railway into a globally admired park inspiring the adaptive reuse of urban spaces (High Line, 2023).',

To address this, NYC prioritizes increasing green space access in low-income regions, supported by scientific evidence showing the positive impact of green areas on health and well-being. However, uncontrolled efforts to enhance green spaces in low-income areas may lead to "green gentrification," a process witnessed in Sunset Park. To counter this, some communities and scholars advocate for a "just green enough" approach, though it may not be the ideal model to combat NYC &rsquo; s green gentrification (Handy, 2020).',

However, this has led to an increase in housing prices in the region, and well-educated middle-class communities have begun to replace the previous working class Latin American communities (Gould&Lewis, 2018).',

            description: 'New York planners face the crucial challenge of enhancing living standards without perpetuating social injustice through green gentrification. Proposed strategies include a two-stage approach. In Stage One, fostering community engagement is vital, with city authorities collaborating closely with locals to comprehend needs and concerns. Simultaneously, green spaces should be constructed based on traditional standards derived from community input. Moving to Stage Two, protective measures for housing must be implemented, stabilizing the affordable housing market amid green projects. Tailored policies in this phase cater to the unique needs of each community. An integrated approach emphasizes ongoing community involvement and active participation in green space development to counter gentrification, ensuring a healthy, affordable living environment for low-income residents (Sirois, 2018). <br>   <br>   Reference:  <br>   <br> Anderson, N.
