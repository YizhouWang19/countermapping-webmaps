    para1: '"A shining city is perhaps all the President sees from the portico of the White House and the veranda of his ranch, where everyone seems to be doing well. But there is another city; there is another part to the shining the city; the part where some people can not pay their mortgages, and most young people can not afford one; where students can not afford the education they need, and middle-class parents watch the dreams they hold for their children evaporate. In this part of the city there are more poor than ever, more families in trouble, more and more people who need help but can not find it. Even worse: There are elderly people who tremble in the basements of the houses there. And there are people who sleep in the city streets, in the gutter, where the glitter does not show. There are ghettos where thousands of young people, without a job or an education, give their lives away to drug dealers every day."',

However, the role of parks in these green spaces has been less studied.   <br>   <br> Currently, there is extensive debate in the field of urban planning about how urban parks affect gentrification (Weiss et al., 2011). Some research suggests that parks can increase the attractiveness of neighborhoods, contribute to rising real estate values, and lead to forced displacement of residents in poor neighborhoods, such as in the park slope area of Brooklyn where median incomes tripled over 50 years (Halasz, 2018).

However, uncontrolled efforts to enhance green spaces in low-income areas may lead to "green gentrification," a process witnessed in Sunset Park.

Proposed strategies include a two-stage approach. In Stage One, fostering community engagement is vital, with city authorities collaborating closely with locals to comprehend needs and concerns. Simultaneously, green spaces should be constructed based on traditional standards derived from community input. Moving to Stage Two, protective measures for housing must be implemented, stabilizing the affordable housing market amid green projects. Tailored policies in this phase cater to the unique needs of each community. An integrated approach emphasizes ongoing community involvement and active participation in green space development to counter gentrification, ensuring a healthy, affordable living environment for low-income residents. <br>   <br>   Reference:',
